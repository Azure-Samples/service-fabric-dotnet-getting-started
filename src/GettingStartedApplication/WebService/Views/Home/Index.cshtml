            <h1>Service Fabric Sample Windows Application</h1>
            <p>This application is a Windows sample to help you get started with Service Fabric. All services target .NET8.<br /> The application consists of multiple services to show how the different types of Service Fabric services work, as well as how they can communicate.</p>

                There are five services in the application. Each of the services have a UI exposed in this web application, which is being hosted by the WebService. The web application is built using HTML and JavaScript and communicate via the HTTP API exposed by the WebService. <br />
                We have added some basic UI elements and implemented calls to some of the exposed HTTP APIs. Feel free to add on to the application.
