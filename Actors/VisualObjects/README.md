# Visual Objects
This sample project uses WebGL to render a set of objects. Each object is represented by an Actor, where the location and trajectory of each is calculated on the server side by the Actor representing the object. 

## How to run Visual Objects
Press ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio to run (or just F5 to debug). Once the application has started, go to [http://localhost:8081/visualobjects](http://localhost:8081/visualobjects). Try opening it in multiple browser windows or on multiple machines to see how the server-side calculation produces the same result on every screen.
